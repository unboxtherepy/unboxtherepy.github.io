Ever wished your website could work like a super-smart robot sales team, learning and growing all by itself? Imagine a website that doesn't just sit there, but actively thinks, understands what people need, and then goes out to find new customers. This sounds like something from a futuristic movie, right? Well, Ben Murray and the PixelNX team are getting ready to launch a product that promises exactly that.

They're introducing OmniSitesAI, a brand-new system designed to create "agentic sites." Think of an agentic site as a super-smart website that can learn on its own and even market itself without you doing much. It's meant to take simple ideas or keywords you give it and turn them into a growing, active online presence. This tool aims to solve the big problem many people face: how to keep a website fresh, find new visitors, and make sales without spending all your time and money on it. OmniSitesAI promises to automate these tasks, letting your website become a tireless digital helper.

This product is for anyone who has a business, sells things online, or wants to make money with websites but feels overwhelmed by all the work involved. If you're tired of constantly updating content, trying to figure out SEO, or spending a fortune on ads, OmniSitesAI is built to be your automated solution. It aims to put your online presence on autopilot, allowing you to focus on other important things.

### Quick Verdict

OmniSitesAI promises a groundbreaking approach to website management with "self-learning, self-marketing agentic sites." At $47, it offers a vision of automation for content, SEO, and lead generation. While the concept is highly appealing for busy marketers and business owners, it's essential to remember this is a pre-launch review based on its ambitious description. The real-world performance of its AI capabilities and true "self-marketing" prowess will only be known after its launch on January 13, 2026. If it delivers on its promises, it could be a game-changer for passive online growth.

## What is OmniSitesAI?

OmniSitesAI is a futuristic software system created by Ben Murray and the PixelNX team. It's designed to build websites that are not just static pages, but intelligent "agentic" entities. Imagine your website having a brain! The main idea is that these sites can "think, learn, and market themselves" almost like a real human sales team.

The core purpose of OmniSitesAI is to take away the manual work of growing and promoting a website. You give it some simple keywords or ideas, and the system is supposed to turn those into a fully functional, living website. This website then supposedly starts to learn about its audience and market, improving itself over time. It aims to automatically generate content, optimize for search engines, and even find new customers, all without constant input from you.

This tool is specifically for people who want to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to automate their online presence. This includes small business owners, affiliate marketers, content creators, and anyone who wants to build multiple niche websites without the massive time commitment usually required. It targets those looking for a hands-off approach to digital marketing and website growth. If you dream of a website that works tirelessly for you, OmniSitesAI is positioned to be that solution.

## Key Features

Since OmniSitesAI is still in its pre-launch phase (launching in 2026), the full list of features isn't completely public yet. However, based on its exciting description, we can understand the core functionalities it promises. These features are all about making your website smart and independent.

### Self-Learning AI Engine
This is a big one! OmniSitesAI claims to have an engine that allows your website to learn. Think of it like a student who continuously studies and gets better. The website will likely analyze user behavior, what content performs well, and what people search for. Over time, it should adapt and optimize itself to be more effective. This means your site isn't static; it constantly evolves to meet demand.

### Automated Content Generation
One of the biggest headaches for website owners is creating new content. OmniSitesAI aims to solve this by automatically generating content. You provide simple keywords, and the system should be able to create articles, blog posts, product descriptions, or other text relevant to your niche. This saves immense time and ensures your site always has fresh information for visitors and search engines.

<p align="center"><img src="https://muncheye.com/wp-content/themes/muncheye/images/affiliates/23.png" alt="Affiliate Marketing Automation Graphic" width="700"></p>

### Self-Marketing Capabilities
This feature is where OmniSitesAI truly stands out. It's not just about building a site; it's about making it market itself. This could involve automated SEO (search engine optimization) to rank higher in Google, social media promotion, or even basic lead generation. The idea is that your website acts like a digital marketing manager, actively working to bring in traffic and convert visitors into customers.

### Agentic Site Technology
The term "agentic" means the site has a sense of purpose and can act on its own. Instead of just displaying information, an agentic site might proactively engage with visitors, suggest products, or guide them through a sales funnel. It's about a website that isn't just a brochure but an active participant in your business. This brings a dynamic, interactive element to your online presence.

### Keyword-to-Site Transformation
The promise is simple: you start with keywords, and OmniSitesAI builds the entire site. This suggests a highly intuitive and automated setup process. Instead of complex coding or design work, you just tell the AI what your site should be about, and it handles the rest. This feature is perfect for beginners or anyone wanting to launch many sites quickly.

### Continuous Growth & Optimization
Because the sites are self-learning, they are designed to grow and improve automatically. This means the AI constantly tweaks and refines your site's content, layout, and marketing strategies. It aims to ensure your website always performs at its best, adapting to new trends and user preferences without you needing to lift a finger. This feature is about sustained, long-term performance.

## How Does It Work?

The core idea behind OmniSitesAI is to make building and growing a website as simple as possible, powered by advanced AI. While the exact step-by-step process will be fully revealed upon launch, based on the description, we can outline a likely workflow for how you'll use it. It's designed to be a "set it and forget it" kind of tool, but with intelligent automation running in the background.

**Step 1: Input Your Core Idea (Keywords)**
First, you won't need to be a web designer or a coding expert. The system is described as turning "simple keywords" into a website. So, your journey would likely begin by telling OmniSitesAI what your site is about. For example, if you want a site about "organic dog food for puppies," you'd simply type in those keywords. This is your initial command to the AI.

**Step 2: OmniSitesAI Builds Your Site**
Once you provide the keywords, the AI takes over. It will use its algorithms to understand your niche and begin constructing your website. This probably involves:
*   Generating initial content (articles, product descriptions, "about us" pages).
*   Designing a suitable layout and visual theme.
*   Setting up basic navigation and structure.
The goal here is to get a functional and appealing website up and running very quickly, based on the AI's understanding of your keywords.

**Step 3: The Site Starts to Learn and Grow**
This is where the "self-learning" aspect kicks in. Once your site is live, OmniSitesAI's intelligent agent will begin monitoring its performance. It will likely watch:
*   How visitors interact with the site (what they click, how long they stay).
*   Which content gets the most attention.
*   What search terms people use to find your site.
Based on this data, the AI will start to make adjustments. It might rephrase headlines, add new sections, or even change the order of content to improve user experience and search engine rankings.

<p align="center"><img src="https://muncheye.com/wp-content/themes/muncheye/images/subscribe.png" alt="Generic Subscribe Button Image" width="700"></p>

**Step 4: The Site Begins Self-Marketing**
Alongside learning, your OmniSitesAI site will also start to market itself. This could involve various automated actions:
*   **SEO Optimization:** Continuously tweaking content and site structure to rank higher on Google for relevant keywords.
*   **Content Promotion:** Potentially sharing new articles or products on social media platforms (if integrated).
*   **Lead Generation:** Setting up forms or calls-to-action to capture visitor information.
The site acts like a tireless marketing assistant, always working to bring in more traffic and convert them into leads or sales.

**Step 5: Monitor and Fine-Tune (Minimal Effort)**
While the system is designed to be highly autonomous, you'll still have a dashboard to monitor its performance. You can check traffic, engagement, and sales figures. If you want to steer the AI in a certain direction or provide new core ideas, you'll likely have options to do so. However, the promise is that your direct input will be minimal, allowing the AI to handle the heavy lifting.

The user experience is expected to be incredibly streamlined. Instead of spending hours on manual tasks, you set up the initial parameters, and then the "agentic" site takes over, continuously working to achieve its goals of growing your online presence and generating results.

## Benefits of Using OmniSitesAI

OmniSitesAI promises a range of significant benefits, especially for anyone looking to make their online presence more efficient and less time-consuming. The core idea is to give you a powerful digital asset that works for you, rather than you constantly working for it.

*   **Massive Time Savings:** Imagine not having to write endless blog posts, constantly check your SEO, or manually share every piece of content. OmniSitesAI aims to automate these tasks, freeing up your precious time. You can focus on your main business, product development, or just enjoy more free time.
*   **Reduced Marketing Costs:** Hiring a full-time marketing team or even a freelancer can be very expensive. With OmniSitesAI's self-marketing features, you could potentially cut down on these costs. The AI acts as your always-on, low-cost marketing assistant, working 24/7.
*   **Continuous Website Growth:** Unlike traditional websites that need constant updates to stay relevant, OmniSitesAI sites are designed to be "self-learning." This means they're always adapting, improving, and growing their content and reach. Your website won't become stale; it will continuously evolve to capture more traffic.
*   **Improved Search Engine Rankings:** With automated SEO and content generation, your OmniSitesAI site is built to rank better on Google and other search engines. Higher rankings mean more visibility, more organic traffic, and ultimately, more potential customers finding your business.
*   **Always-On Sales & Lead Generation:** The "agentic" nature of these sites means they are actively working to attract and convert visitors. They can act like a tireless sales team, engaging potential customers, providing information, and guiding them towards a purchase or a lead capture form, even when you're asleep.
*   **Scalability for Multiple Niches:** If you want to build many niche websites for different products or services, OmniSitesAI makes this much easier. You can potentially launch several self-sufficient sites without individually managing each one, allowing you to scale your online empire rapidly.
*   **Beginner-Friendly Automation:** For those new to website building or digital marketing, the idea of an AI doing the heavy lifting is a huge advantage. You don't need technical skills or marketing expertise to get a powerful, performing website online. You simply provide the core idea, and the AI handles the rest.

These benefits combine to offer a powerful solution for anyone seeking to maximize their online impact with minimal personal effort and expense. OmniSitesAI positions itself as a revolutionary tool for effortless digital expansion.

## Pricing & Packages

OmniSitesAI is set to launch at a very accessible price point. The front-end offer is **$47**. This is a one-time payment, meaning you buy it once and, based on typical JVZoo launches, you own the core software.

**Value Analysis:**
For $47, if OmniSitesAI genuinely delivers on its promise of "self-learning, self-marketing agentic sites," it represents incredible value.
*   **Website Creation:** Building a website from scratch typically costs hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars (designers, developers, content writers).
*   **Content Generation:** AI content tools often have monthly subscription fees.
*   **SEO Services:** Hiring SEO experts can run into hundreds or thousands per month.
*   **Marketing Automation:** Tools for email marketing, social media scheduling, etc., also carry recurring costs.

If OmniSitesAI bundles these capabilities into a single, one-time payment of $47, it could offer a significant return on investment (ROI). It aims to replace multiple costly services and manual tasks with a single, affordable solution. The value proposition lies in the automation and the potential to generate leads and sales without ongoing significant expenditure.

**Money-Back Guarantee Details:**
The provided information does not specify a money-back guarantee. In the absence of this detail, users should assume there isn't one, or that they would need to check the official sales page upon launch for the specific terms. Most JVZoo products do come with at least a 30-day money-back guarantee, but this is not confirmed for OmniSitesAI based on the current data. It's always wise to check the sales page carefully at the time of purchase for any guarantee information.

## Pros and Cons

Like any powerful new tool, OmniSitesAI comes with its own set of advantages and potential drawbacks. It's important to look at both sides honestly, especially with a product that uses cutting-edge AI and is yet to be launched.

| Pros                                         | Cons                                                               |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Highly Automated Website Growth:** Sites learn and market themselves, saving immense time and effort. | **Unproven Technology:** As a pre-launch product, its "self-learning, self-marketing" claims are not yet demonstrated in real-world use. |
| **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Potentially limitless, fresh content without manual writing. | **Potential for Generic Content:** AI-generated content can sometimes lack human nuance, unique voice, or deep insights. |
| **Significant Cost Savings:** Replaces the need for web designers, content writers, and marketing agencies. | **Limited Control/Customization:** High automation might mean less direct control over specific design elements or marketing strategies. |
| **Boosts SEO Automatically:** Aims to improve search engine rankings without constant manual optimization. | **Reliance on AI Accuracy:** If the AI makes errors in learning or marketing, it could negatively impact your brand or results. |
| **Scalable for Multiple Projects:** Easy to launch and manage many niche sites simultaneously. | **Future Launch Date (2026):** No immediate access, meaning reviews and testimonials are not available yet. This review is based on promises. |
| **Beginner-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be simple, turning keywords into active websites. | **Over-Automation Risks:** Over-reliance on AI might lead to a lack of genuine human connection with your audience. |
| **Always-On Digital Sales Team:** Sites actively work to generate leads and sales 24/7. | **Potential for OTOs/Upsells:** JVZoo products often have multiple upsells, increasing the total cost for full functionality. (Not specified, but common). |

**Quick Summary: Pros**
OmniSitesAI's biggest strength lies in its promise of extreme automation for website creation, growth, and marketing. It aims to save users time and money by letting AI handle content, SEO, and sales tasks. This makes it ideal for scaling projects and for those who lack technical skills.

**Quick Summary: Cons**
The main drawback is that OmniSitesAI is a pre-launch product. Its revolutionary claims are yet to be validated by real-world performance. There's a risk of AI-generated content being generic, and users might experience limited control over customization. Additionally, relying heavily on AI means potential issues if the AI isn't perfectly accurate or if there are unexpected upsells for key features.

## Who Should Buy OmniSitesAI?

OmniSitesAI is designed with a specific type of user in mind, primarily those looking to leverage automation and AI to build and grow their online presence efficiently.

**Ideal Customers:**

*   **Small Business Owners:** If you run a local business and need an online presence that actively brings in customers without requiring your constant attention, OmniSitesAI could be a dream come true. It can create and market your business site automatically.
*   **Affiliate Marketers:** Building many niche review sites or product promotion sites can be incredibly time-consuming. OmniSitesAI's promise of rapid site creation and self-marketing makes it perfect for quickly launching multiple affiliate assets.
*   **Digital Marketers:** Agencies or freelancers who manage websites for clients could use OmniSitesAI to scale their services. Imagine offering clients "self-growing" websites with minimal management effort.
*   **Content Creators & Bloggers:** If you struggle to consistently produce new content or promote your blog, the automated content generation and self-marketing features could keep your site fresh and visible without burning you out.
*   **Entrepreneurs & Startups:** For those looking to quickly test market ideas or launch products with an active online presence, OmniSitesAI offers a fast, low-cost way to get agentic websites up and running.
*   **Anyone Seeking Passive Income:** If your goal is to set up online assets that generate income with minimal ongoing effort, the "self-learning, self-marketing" aspect aligns perfectly with a passive income strategy.
*   **Beginners in Web Development:** If you have no coding or design skills but want a professional, performing website, OmniSitesAI aims to simplify the entire process.

**Who Shouldn't Buy (Be Honest):**

*   **Control Freaks & Customization Experts:** If you absolutely need pixel-perfect control over every design element, code snippet, and marketing strategy, a highly automated AI system might feel too restrictive.
*   **Those Skeptical of AI:** If you don't trust AI to handle important aspects of your online presence or prefer a human touch in all content and marketing, OmniSitesAI might not be for you.
*   **People Needing Immediate Results:** While promising, OmniSitesAI is a pre-launch product. Its "self-learning" aspect implies growth over time, not instant overnight success. Patience will likely be required.
*   **Businesses Requiring Highly Specific, Niche Human Expertise:** For highly technical niches or those demanding a very specific, unique human voice and authority, fully automated AI might not deliver the required depth or authenticity.
*   **Those with Existing Complex Websites:** If you already have a large, established website with intricate integrations, migrating to or relying solely on a new AI system like OmniSitesAI might be impractical or introduce complications.

In summary, OmniSitesAI is for the forward-thinking individual or business ready to embrace AI for efficiency and scale, especially if they value automation over granular control.

## Bonuses & Special Offers

At the time of writing this pre-launch review, the product information provided explicitly states `BONUSES: []`. This means that no specific bonuses have been announced or detailed yet for OmniSitesAI by Ben Murray et al.

It's very common for products launching on platforms like JVZoo to come with a bundle of valuable bonuses. These bonuses are usually extra tools, training, or resources that complement the main product and enhance its value. They often aim to help users get even better results with the core software.

However, since no bonuses are listed now, we cannot mention any specific items.

**What to Expect (Likely Scenarios):**

*   **Upon Launch:** When OmniSitesAI officially launches on January 13, 2026, Ben Murray and the PixelNX team will very likely include several bonuses as part of their launch offer. These might include:

    *   **Additional Software/Tools:** Complementary apps for specific marketing tasks, like lead generation, traffic, or graphics.

These bonuses can significantly increase the overall value of your purchase. Also, look out for any exclusive deals or discounts that might be available during the initial launch period.

## OmniSitesAI vs Competitors

OmniSitesAI is entering a crowded but evolving market of website builders and AI tools. Its unique selling proposition (USP) lies in its "self-learning, self-marketing agentic sites." Let's compare it to some general categories of competitors to highlight its distinct features.

**1. Traditional Website Builders (e.g., WordPress, Wix, Squarespace):**
These platforms offer robust tools for building websites. WordPress, combined with plugins, can do almost anything. Wix and Squarespace are known for ease of use and beautiful templates.

| Feature             | OmniSitesAI                                      | WordPress/Wix/Squarespace                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site Creation**   | AI-driven from keywords, highly automated.       | Manual drag-and-drop, template customization, coding (WP). |
| **Content**         | AI-generated & optimized automatically.          | Manually written, requires user input.              |
| **Marketing**       | Self-marketing (SEO, lead gen), autonomous.      | Requires manual setup of SEO, ads, social sharing.  |
| **Learning/Growth** | Self-learning AI, adapts & improves over time.   | Static, requires manual updates and analysis.       |
| **Effort**          | Minimal ongoing effort (set & forget, monitor).  | Significant ongoing effort (content, SEO, marketing). |
| **Cost**            | $47 one-time (front-end).                        | Varies: Free (WP core) to monthly subscriptions, hosting, plugins, themes. |
| **Control**         | Less granular control, AI-driven.                | High control, full customization options.           |
| **USP**             | Autonomous, "agentic" sites, self-growing.       | Flexibility, vast features, strong community (WP).  |

**Unique Selling Points of OmniSitesAI:** The key difference is the *autonomy*. While other platforms give you the tools, you have to do the work. OmniSitesAI promises to *do the work for you* through its self-learning and self-marketing capabilities. This is a game-changer for passive growth.

**2. AI Content Generators (e.g., Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic):**
These tools excel at generating text, blog posts, sales copy, and more using AI. They automate content creation.

| Feature             | OmniSitesAI                                      | AI Content Generators (e.g., Jasper)              |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Function**| Full website creation & growth, including content & marketing. | Primarily content generation.                   |
| **Content**         | Integrated, AI-generated, and optimized within the site. | Generates content, but user must paste & publish. |
| **Marketing**       | Self-marketing for the entire site.              | No direct marketing features for a website.       |
| **Learning/Growth** | Sites learn and grow based on performance.       | Generates content based on prompts, no self-learning for a website. |
| **Effort**          | Minimal once set up.                             | User still manages publishing, SEO, site management. |
| **Cost**            | $47 one-time (front-end).                        | Typically monthly subscriptions (often $30-$100+). |
| **Control**         | Less control over raw content output.            | High control over content output, but manual integration. |
| **USP**             | Holistic site automation, content is just one part. | Specialized, high-quality content generation.     |

**Unique Selling Points of OmniSitesAI:** OmniSitesAI integrates content creation directly into the website's lifecycle, along with marketing and learning. It's a complete ecosystem, not just a content tool. This means less manual work than using a separate AI content generator and then manually integrating that content into a website.

**3. Basic AI Website Builders (e.g., Hostinger AI Website Builder, certain Duda features):**
Some newer website builders use AI to quickly create initial website drafts based on user input.

| Feature             | OmniSitesAI                                      | Basic AI Website Builders                         |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Automation Depth**| Self-learning, self-marketing, continuous growth. | Generates initial site structure/content, then mostly manual. |
| **Ongoing Maint.**  | Autonomous updates and optimization.             | Requires manual updates, SEO, marketing.          |
| **Intelligence**    | "Agentic" site that thinks and learns.           | AI assists in initial setup, but lacks ongoing intelligence. |
| **Effort**          | Very low ongoing effort.                         | Low initial effort, but high ongoing effort.      |
| **Cost**            | $47 one-time (front-end).                        | Often part of hosting packages or monthly subscriptions. |
| **USP**             | True autonomy, sites evolve and market themselves. | Quick initial setup, good for basic static sites. |

**Unique Selling Points of OmniSitesAI:** The main difference here is the *ongoing intelligence and automation*. While basic AI builders help you *start* a site quickly, OmniSitesAI promises that the site will *continue to grow and market itself* without further significant intervention, evolving beyond a static presence.

**Conclusion:**
OmniSitesAI aims to carve out a new niche by offering a truly autonomous, "agentic" website experience. It doesn't just build a site or generate content; it promises a complete, self-managing, and self-marketing digital entity. If its technology lives up to the description, it could be a significant leap forward in reducing the manual burden of online presence management, setting it apart from current competitors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions you might have about OmniSitesAI, answered based on the available information:

### Q1: What exactly is an "agentic site"?
**A:** An "agentic site" means your website isn't just a static display of information. It acts like an intelligent agent. It can "think," "learn," and "market itself" automatically, constantly working to grow its online presence and attract customers, much like a human sales or marketing team.

### Q2: Is OmniSitesAI suitable for beginners?
**A:** Yes, it is designed to be beginner-friendly. The description highlights that it turns "simple keywords" into a functioning site. This suggests you won't need technical skills in web design, coding, or complex marketing to get started.

### Q3: When will OmniSitesAI be available?
**A:** OmniSitesAI is scheduled to launch on January 13, 2026. This review is based on pre-launch information and its promised capabilities.

### Q4: What kind of businesses can benefit from OmniSitesAI?
**A:** Many types! Small business owners, affiliate marketers, local businesses, digital marketing agencies, content creators, and anyone looking to create an active online presence with minimal manual effort can benefit.

### Q5: Will I still need to create content for my website?
**A:** The main promise is "automated content generation." This means you input keywords, and the AI should create content for you. The goal is to significantly reduce or eliminate the need for you to write content manually.

### Q6: How does the "self-marketing" feature work?
**A:** While specific details are pending launch, self-marketing likely involves automated SEO (optimizing your site for search engines), potentially social media integration, and strategies to generate leads or sales, all managed by the AI without your constant intervention.

### Q7: Can I customize the look of my OmniSitesAI website?
**A:** The focus is on automation and AI-driven design. While there might be some customization options, highly granular control over every design element might be limited compared to traditional website builders, as the AI is meant to handle much of this automatically for optimal performance.

### Q8: Is this a one-time purchase or a subscription?
**A:** The front-end price is listed as $47, which typically indicates a one-time payment for the core product on the JVZoo platform. However, always check the sales page at launch for any details about potential recurring costs for advanced features or ongoing services (like hosting if not included).

### Q9: What if the AI generates poor-quality content or marketing?
**A:** This is a valid concern with any AI tool. While OmniSitesAI claims to be "self-learning," the quality of its output and marketing effectiveness will only be fully proven after launch. You would likely have a dashboard to monitor performance and make adjustments or provide feedback to guide the AI.

### Q10: Does OmniSitesAI include hosting for the websites it creates?
**A:** The product description doesn't explicitly mention hosting. Some AI website builders include basic hosting, while others require you to connect your own. You should confirm this detail on the official sales page when the product launches.

## Final Verdict

OmniSitesAI, by Ben Murray et al., presents a truly ambitious and exciting vision for the future of online presence. The concept of "self-learning, self-marketing agentic sites" that grow automatically sounds like something ripped from a sci-fi novel, offering a tempting solution to the endless manual tasks of website management and digital marketing. At its launch price of $47, the potential value is immense if it delivers on its promises.

The product aims to eliminate the need for constant content creation, SEO optimization, and active marketing efforts, essentially transforming your website into a tireless, intelligent digital employee. For small business owners, affiliate marketers, and anyone overwhelmed by the demands of online growth, this could be a game-changer, freeing up valuable time and potentially saving significant costs. The idea of simply providing keywords and having an entire, evolving online presence built and maintained by AI is incredibly appealing.

However, it's crucial to approach OmniSitesAI with a balanced perspective. As a pre-launch product (launching in 2026), its revolutionary claims are yet to be tested in the real world. The effectiveness of its "self-learning" and "self-marketing" AI, the quality of its automated content, and the actual level of autonomy it provides will only become clear after its release and through user feedback. There's always a possibility that highly automated AI solutions might lack the nuanced touch of human creativity or require more oversight than initially advertised.

It offers a futuristic solution for automated online growth that could redefine how we approach websites. However, for those who prefer concrete, proven results and granular control, it might be wise to wait for post-launch reviews and testimonials.
