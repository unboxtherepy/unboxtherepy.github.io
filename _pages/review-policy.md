<p>At <strong>unboxtherapy</strong>, we are committed to delivering honest, unbiased, and research-driven product reviews. Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions with full transparency into how we evaluate and recommend products.</p>

<h2>1. How We Review Products</h2>
<p>Our review process is designed to be fair, accurate, and helpful. We evaluate products based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build quality and durability</li>
  <li>Features and specifications</li>
  <li>Real-world performance</li>
  <li>Pricing and value for money</li>
  <li>User feedback and market reputation</li>
  <li>Brand credibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever possible, we rely on hands-on testing. If testing is not possible, we use verified manufacturer data, reputable third-party sources, and customer insights.</p>

<h2>2. Independence and Transparency</h2>
<p>Our reviews are <strong>never influenced</strong> by brands, sponsors, or affiliate partnerships. We maintain editorial independence at all times.</p>
<p>If a product is provided to us for free, we will clearly disclose it in the review without altering our opinions.</p>

<h2>3. Affiliate Links</h2>
<p>Some of our posts may contain affiliate links. Clicking these links may earn us a commission at no additional cost to you. This allows us to keep the website running while continuing to offer free, high-quality content.</p>
<p>Affiliate commissions <strong>do not</strong> impact our review results or opinions. For more details, refer to our <a href="/affiliate-disclosure/">Affiliate Disclosure</a> page.</p>

<h2>4. Accuracy and Updates</h2>
<p>Product details, pricing, and availability may change over time. We strive to keep our reviews updated, but we recommend verifying specs directly with the manufacturer or seller.</p>

<h2>5. Sponsored Content</h2>
<p>We may occasionally publish sponsored posts. Sponsored content will always be clearly labeled and will not influence our editorial product reviews.</p>

<h2>6. User Feedback</h2>
<p>We value user experiences and welcome feedback that may help improve the accuracy and usefulness of our reviews. If you find any outdated or incorrect information, feel free to contact us.</p>
