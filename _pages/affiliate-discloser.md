---

At **[Unbox Therapy](unboxtherapy.github.io)**, transparency is important to us. This Affiliate Disclosure explains how affiliate links work on our site and how they support our content.

## 1. What Are Affiliate Links?

Some links on our website are **affiliate links**. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission — at **no extra cost to you**.

These commissions help us:

* Maintain and improve the website
* Purchase products for honest reviews
* Create in-depth guides and comparisons
* Continue offering free content to our readers

## 2. Why We Use Affiliate Links

Running a high-quality review site takes time, tools, and resources. Affiliate partnerships allow us to keep producing honest, unbiased content without charging readers.

## 3. Our Commitment to Honest Reviews

Even though we may earn commissions:

* **We never accept money in exchange for biased reviews.**
* **All opinions are our own** and based on real usage, testing, or trusted user data.
* **We do not promote products we do not believe in.**

Affiliate relationships do not influence:

* Product ratings
* Review conclusions
* Recommendations

## 4. Partner Programs We Use

We may participate in various affiliate programs, including but not limited to:

* Amazon Associates
* Affiliate networks (e.g., Awin, ShareASale, Impact)
* Brand-specific partner programs

Each of these may use cookies or tracking to verify referrals.

## 5. Reader Responsibility

Before buying any product, we encourage readers to:

* Review product specifications
* Compare prices
* Check updated user reviews
* Make informed decisions

## 6. Your Support Means a Lot

When you use our affiliate links, you directly support Unbox Therapy and help keep the site running. We truly appreciate your trust.
